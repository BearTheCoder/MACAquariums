# About

Hi, Hello.
https://www.macaquariums.com was a commission an IRL coworker asked of me in order for him to take his business online. He had no coding experience and wanted to learn 
little to none. In order to accomidate his request I programmed an entire backend/user interface that he could use to control his website as if he was controlling something 
similar that he might have used online, such as Facebook or Instagram. The website layout he wanted to be heavily focused on photos, so I designed the layout to look similar 
to websites like Pinterest.

Also, he wanted the website to be free. (Except for my commission costs)

Initially, I thought he was asking for a bit much, but also, I had been meaning to learn Firebase, and I figured if I am going to spend time learning something, might 
be worthwhile to apply it towards and actual project.

After about a month of work, the website is live and is ready for him to use. How the front end looks is entirely dependant on how many posts the client creates.

Below are a few screenshots.

Ok, bye.

# Issues and Excuses

-   Issue # 1 - Mobile Homepage
Might not be an issue as I think fitting more on the home screen makes more sense while trying to port people to proper sections, though I think that maybe 
it might be benefitial for the "products" instead of scaling in size when on mobile, maybe add a condition to switch them to a flex-column instead of row so they 
maintain a readable size.
