  In order to make your website experience as plesant as possible, some method of organizing the website 
  was necessary without the user (you) needing to learn something new. 

  <br><br>This is the category system.<br><br> 
  
  With categories, I can programmatically organize the side of the website that your customer sees.
  What does this offer? You, the website owner has a user experience similar to instagram or facebook. 
  Also, it's cheap. One program to rule them all, and no developer you have to keep on payroll. 
  But you sacrafice customizability. 
  You win some and you lose some.

  {
    name: "Importance Values",
    info: `
  Importance values are not visible to the customer.
  <br><br>
  Importance values determine how each category is organized. 
  These importance values are sorted from low to high, meaning the lower the number 
  the higher up on the page it is when a customer first clicks the page. 
  This feature was intended to give you, the client, better control over organizing your page 
  without you having to learn something new, and without me, the developer, from having to spend months 
  on an interface that is way to advance for what the website actually is. 
  If you do not know what importance value to create at the time of posting, the importance value can be changed 
  later in the "edit posts" section. 
  
`},
  {
    name: "Posts",
    info: `
  Similar to Instagram and Pinterest, your website is a "content container".
  <br><br>
  Through the "post" module you can create new posts that will be visible to the customer through the front end of the website.
  Each "post" lives seperately and can be sorted seperately from each other. This is done through importance values and categories.
  Each post can be changed and delete in the "edit posts" module.
